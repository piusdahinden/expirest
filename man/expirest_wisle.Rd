\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with the columns specified by \code{response_vbl},
\code{time_vbl} and \code{batch_vbl}.}

\item{response_vbl}{A character string specifying the response variable name
that must be a column of \code{data}.}

\item{time_vbl}{A character string specifying the time variable name that
must be a column of \code{data}.}

\item{batch_vbl}{A character string specifying the column in \code{data}
with the grouping information (i.e. a factorial variable) for the
differentiation of the observations of the different batches.}

\item{rl}{A numeric value or a numeric vector specifying the release
specification limit(s) for which the corresponding expiry should be
estimated.}

\item{rl_sf}{A positive integer or a vector of positive integers specifying
the number of \dQuote{significant figures} (sf) of \code{rl}. It must have
the same length as \code{rl}.}

\item{sl}{A numeric value or a numeric vector of length \code{2} specifying
the specification limit or limits. If a vector is provided it must be of
the form \code{c(lower limit, upper limit)}.}

\item{sl_sf}{A positive integer or a vector of positive integers specifying
the number of \dQuote{significant figures} (sf) of \code{sl}. It must have
the same length as \code{sl}.}

\item{srch_range}{A vector of length \code{2} specifying the end-points of
the (time) range that is supposed to contain the shelf life or retest
period.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the significance
level for the calculation of confidence or prediction intervals. The
default is \code{0.05}.}

\item{alpha_pool}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the type I
error rate for the test of the poolability of the batches. The default
is \code{0.25}, following ICH Q1E guideline. The value should not be
changed unless supported by well-founded reasons.}

\item{xform}{A vector of two character strings specifying the transformation
of the response and the time variable. The default is \dQuote{no}
transformation, i.e. \code{c("no", "no")}, where the first element
specifies the transformation of the \eqn{x} variable and the second
element the transformation of the \eqn{y} variable. Valid alternatives
for \eqn{x} and/or \eqn{y} variable transformation are \code{"log"}
(natural logarithm), \code{"sqrt"} (square root) and \code{"sq"} (square).}

\item{shift}{A vector of two values which will be added to the variables
\eqn{x} and/or \eqn{y} before they are transformed as specified by the
\code{xform} parameter, where the first element will be added to the
\eqn{x} variable and the second element to the \eqn{y} variable. The
purpose is to prevent an undefined state which could arise when variables
with values of \eqn{\leq 0} are log or square root transformed. The
default is \code{c(0, 0)}.}

\item{sf_option}{A character string specifying if the limits (\code{rl}
or \code{sl}) should be regarded as \dQuote{tight} or \dQuote{loose}, i.e.
either \code{"tight"} or \code{"loose"}, respectively. The option
\code{"tight"} means that the limits are rounded to the specified number
of significant figures specified by the parameters \code{rl_sf} and
\code{sl_sf}. In case of the option \code{"loose"} the limits are rounded
to the specified number of significant figures (\eqn{n}), followed by the
subtraction of \eqn{1} from the \eqn{n^{th}} digit and addition of
\eqn{5} to the \eqn{(n + 1)^{th}} digit if \code{ivl_side} is
\code{"lower"}, or followed by the addition of \eqn{4} to the
\eqn{(n + 1)^{th}} digit if \code{ivl_side} is \code{"upper"}.}

\code{"prediction"}, i.e. specifying the type of interval of interest.
The default is \code{"confidence"}.}

\item{ivl_type}{A character string specifying if a \dQuote{one sided} or

\code{"one.sided"} or \code{"two.sided"}, respectively. The default is
\code{"one.sided"}.}

\item{ivl_side}{A character string specifying if the \dQuote{upper} or the
\dQuote{lower} limit is the relevant limit, i.e. either \code{"upper"} or
\code{"lower"}, respectively. The default is \code{"lower"}.}

\item{...}{Additional named or unnamed arguments passed on to
\code{uniroot()}.}

\description{
Based on a linear regression model fitted to a stability data set the
function \code{expirest_wisle()} estimates the shelf life, or retest period,
for the specified release and specification limit following the ARGPM
guidance \dQuote{Stability testing for prescription medicines}. The
abbreviation \dQuote{wisle} stands for \dQuote{what-if shelf life estimation}
(because it estimates the shelf life (\dQuote{what}) for a given release
limit (\dQuote{if})).
}
\details{
For the shelf life estimation for submissions in Australia the
Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM), i.e.
the guidance \dQuote{Stability testing for prescription medicines}, is
binding. In chapter 14.3.1, \dQuote{Predicting shelf life from stability
data}, it is described how the estimation should be done. It recommends
to take the worst case situation at batch release into account. The
following examples are listed:
\describe{
 \item{1a)}{For medicine that has a lower Assay release limit of 95 per cent
   and a lower assay expiry limit of 90 per cent, the maximum decrease in
   assay allowed over the shelf-life is 5 per cent.}
 \item{2a)}{Similarly, for a medicine that has a release limit for an
   individual impurity of 0.2 per cent and an expiry limit of 0.5 per cent,
   the maximum increase in the impurity allowed over the shelf life is
   0.3 per cent.}
 \item{1b)}{For the same medicine, if the actual release assay result is
   101 per cent, then the shelf life should be determined at the time the
   medicine (or confidence interval of the regression line) decreases by
   5 per cent and reaches 96 per cent, rather than the expiry limit
   (90 per cent). This takes into account the possibility of batches being
   released at the lower release limit (i.e. 95 per cent) and ensures they
   will comply with the expiry limit throughout the shelf life.}
 \item{2b)}{Similarly, if the actual impurity content is 0.1 per cent at
   batch release, the shelf life should be determined as the time the
   95 per cent confidence interval reaches 0.4 per cent (i.e. increases by
   0.3 per cent).}
}

Consequently, it is necessary to define
\itemize{
 \item a release limit and
 \item an expiry limit or shelf life limit (usually the specification limit).
}
If both of these limits were the same the shelf life would be zero, i.e. no
change allowed. \cr

For the estimation of the shelf life or expiry limit it is necessary to find
the point where the upper or lower 95\% confidence interval limit of the
linear model fitted to the data (by aid of \code{lm}) intersects the
\dQuote{worst case scenario limit} (WCSL), which is defined by the ARGPM
guidance \dQuote{Stability testing for prescription medicines} as the
intercept \eqn{\pm} difference between the specification limit and the
release limit, where this differences is added (\eqn{+}) if the upper limit
is relevant or it is subtracted (\eqn{-}) if the lower limit is relevant.
In this package, this point is called the \dQuote{point of intersection} or
\dQuote{point of interest}, abbreviated POI.

Before performing the retest period or shelf life estimation the most
suitable model should be determined. It should particularly be verified
if data of all test batches are poolable or not. Details on this are
described in section \dQuote{Checking batch poolability} below.
}
\section{Checking batch poolability}{

According to ICH Q1E guideline, construction of the 95\% confidence interval
on the basis of the combined data of all test batches is allowed only if it
has been confirmed by aid of a statistical test whether the regression lines
from the different batches have a common slope and a common intercept. A
significance level of \code{alpha_pool = 0.25} has to be used for both
batch-related terms, and the test of the slopes has to precede the test of
the intercepts. From these tests, three possible models may be appropriate,
i.e.
\itemize{
 \item a \emph{common intercept / common slope} model (cics),
 \item a \emph{different intercept / common slope} model (dics) or
 \item a \emph{different intercept / different slope} model (dids).
}
The \emph{common intercept / different slope} model is not of practical
relevance because the corresponding model is missing an effect. If the slopes
are significantly different, there is no point comparing intercepts.

These requirements can be checked by aid of an \dQuote{ANalysis of
COVAriance} (ANCOVA) including the batch variable as interaction term. The
full ANCOVA model simultaneously tests all the effects, and non-significant
effects can be identified and removed for fitting of the final regression
model that is used for the estimation of the shelf life or retest period.

The significance level (\code{alpha_pool = 0.25}, Type I error) is used to
increase the power of the test to detect cases where the data should not be
pooled. Setting \code{alpha_pool = 0.25} decreases the probability of
incorrectly concluding that stability data from multiple batches can be
pooled. On the other hand, though, it increases the probability of using a
single batch to determine expiry when pooling batches would be more
appropriate.
