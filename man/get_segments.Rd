\title{Prepare segments explaining graphical elements}
\usage{
get_segments(model, x_range, rl_index, mtbs = "verified")
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An \sQuote{\code{expirest_osle}} or an
\sQuote{\code{expirest_Wisle}} object, i.e. a list returned
by the \code{\link{expirest_osle}()} or by the
\code{\link{expirest_wisle}()} function.}

\item{x_range}{A numeric vector of the form \code{c(min, max)} that
specifies the range of the time variable to be plotted.}

\item{rl_index}{A positive integer that specifies which of the release limit
values that have been handed over to \code{\link{expirest_wisle}()} should
be displayed. The default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{mtbs}{A character string that specifies the \dQuote{model to be shown},
i.e. either \code{verified}, which is the default, or one of \code{cics},
\code{dics}, \code{dids} or \code{dids.pmse}. The \code{verified} model
is the model that was identified through the poolability check. It is
thus also one of the possible optional models. The \code{dids} model
represents the case where a separate model is fitted to the data of each
individual batch while the \code{dids.pmse} model is the interaction
model which includes the \eqn{batch} variable as main effect and in the
interaction term with the \eqn{time} variable (\eqn{batch \times time}),
i.e. a model where the mean square error is pooled across batches.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the columns \sQuote{Time.1}, \sQuote{Time.2},
\sQuote{Response.1}, \sQuote{Response.2}, Item, Colour, Type and Size is
returned, where the column names \sQuote{Time.1}, \sQuote{Time.2},
\sQuote{Response.1} and \sQuote{Response.2} are placeholders for the
corresponding variable names. The items in the four rows represent the
maximal allowed difference over time from the intercept (shown as red
dashed horizontal line), the release limit (shown as black dotted horizontal
line), the maximal allowed difference over time from the specification limit
(shown as grey solid vertical line) and the maximal allowed difference over
time from the intercept (shown as grey solid vertical line).

\description{
The function \code{get_segments()} prepares a data frame for putting
segments on a plot prepared by the \code{ggplot()} function from the
\sQuote{\code{ggplot2}} package.
}
\details{
The function \code{get_segments()} expects various pieces
of information characterising an \sQuote{\code{expirest_osle}} or an
\sQuote{\code{expirest_wisle}} model. Based on the information provided,
the function prepares a data frame that that is used by the function
\code{\link{plot_expirest_wisle}(})) to put line segments on the graph that
is prepared by this function.
