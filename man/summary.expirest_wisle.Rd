\usage{
\method{summary}{expirest_wisle}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \sQuote{\code{expirest_wisle}} returned
by the \code{\link{expirest_wisle}()} function.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods or arguments
that can be passed down to the \code{\link[base]{formatC}()} function.}
}
\value{
The \sQuote{\code{expirest_wisle}} object passed to the
\code{object} parameter is returned invisibly.
}
\description{
This is a method for the function \code{summary()} for objects of class
\sQuote{\code{expirest_wisle}}.
}
\details{
The function \code{\link{expirest_wisle}()} estimates the expiry
for the specified release and specification limit following the ARGPM
guidance \dQuote{Stability testing for prescription medicines}. By default,
batch poolability is checked as recommended by the ICH Q1E guideline at a
significance level of 0.25. Other levels can be used, although not
recommended, by changing the default of the \code{alpha_pool} parameter.
Three possible models may be appropriate, i.e.
\itemize{
 \item a \emph{common intercept / common slope} model (cics),
 \item a \emph{different intercept / common slope} model (dics) or
 \item a \emph{different intercept / different slope} model (dids).
}

The worst case intercept is the intercept of the batch whose confidence
limit is the first crossing the acceptance limit. As in case of the
\code{cics} model type all batches have a common intercept and a common
confidence interval, all batches can be regarded as equally worst case. In
case of the \code{dids} model type, shelf life estimation is done using the
models obtained from fitting the data of each batch individually. In
addition to the shelf life estimated according to the ARGPM also the
estimate according to ICH Q1E is shown.
