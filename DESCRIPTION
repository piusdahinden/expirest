Description: This package supports shelf life estimation for chemically
    derived medicines according to the worst-case scenario described in the
    Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM),
    guidance on 'Stability testing for prescription medicines' (chapter 14.3.1).
    According to this guidance, it is necessary to predict shelf life from
    stability data, taking into account the worst case situation at batch
    release. If a change over time is observed, a release limit needs to be
    specified. This package supports finding a release limit and the associated
    shelf life.
