## First submission

This is the second iteration of the first submission. In this version I have:

- Unwrapped examples that were wrapped by \\dontrun{} that are executable in
  < 5 sec.
- Replaced \\dontrun{} by tryCatch() in order to catch errors from examples
  that deliberately produce errors.

## Test environments

- Local windows-x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (R 4.1.2)
- Win-builder windows-x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (R 4.0.5)
- R-hub windows-x86_64-devel (r-devel)
- R-hub ubuntu-gcc-release (r-release)
- R-hub fedora-clang-devel (r-devel)
